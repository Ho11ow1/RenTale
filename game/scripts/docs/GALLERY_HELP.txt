=== Methods that can be used to easily change how Gallery is displayed ===

For a tab like system which only displays events that have a name starting with a given string / character:

# Declare your initial selectedState
default selectedGallery = "All"

    # Create a menu to switch between your "tabs"
    hbox:
        spacing 10
        textbutton "All" action SetScreenVariable("selectedGallery", "All")
        textbutton "Megan" action SetScreenVariable("selectedGallery", "Megan")
        textbutton "Willow" action SetScreenVariable("selectedGallery", "Willow")

    # Create a conditional use statement which reacts to your selectedGallery variable
    if selectedGallery == "All":
        use Gallery_Grid_All
    elif selectedGallery == "Megan":
        use Gallery_Grid_Filtered("Megan")
    elif selectedGallery == "Willow":
        use Gallery_Grid_Filtered("Willow")


# Create screens to be used inside of the Gallery screens
screen Gallery_Grid_All():
    grid 4 4:
        for name, data in persistent.gallery.items():


screen Gallery_Grid_Filtered(characterName):
    grid 4 4:
        for name, data in filter(lambda kvp: kvp[0].startswith(f"{characterName}_"), persistent.gallery.items()):


Using this architecture you've just created a condition based component like Gallery view,


For Gallery_Grid_All, All GalleryItems inside of persistent.gallery will be displayed


For Gallery_Grid_Filtered, Only GalleryItems which names begin with "CharacterName_" will be displayed,
    # Note: For this exact code to work, you must name your GalleryItems for example: "Megan_Meet", "Alice_Love_1", "Mia_Return"
    To achieve this we use a combination of filter and lambda, the filter operation takes in a condition function or lambda and the object to be filtered,
    our lambda in the instance: takes in a KeyValuePair which is the structure of a dictionary,
    grabs the first element which is the name and if it matches our condition it gives that kvp back to us to use inside of our for loop

NOTE: This is just one way in which tabs can be implemented,
    Each game is different and does things differently, Feel free to modify this approach to fit your needs
