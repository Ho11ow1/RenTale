=== How to combine area and screen interactivity ===
For this you will need both a screen and a label
Either use Screens & Areas.rpy, or if you're working on something bigger, use the pre-existing visual/ folders for a more maintainable project.

Creating an area / label for our screen:
    label Area:
        $ result = call screen "ScreenName" / $ result = RenTale.Managers.SceneManager.CleanCallScreen("ScreenName")

        if (result == "")
            pass
        
        elif (result == "")
            pass

        ... # More of your logic

Using this format we have the screen tell us what the user wants to do and based on its [action Return("")] we then take action.

Creating an interactive screen for our area / label:
    screen ExampleScreen:
        frame: # Create a window with a background
            xfill True # Take up entire width
            yfill True # Take up entire height
            ... # Other properties

            vbox: # Create a vertical box to hold your interaction buttons
                ... # Properties and buttons (imagebutton, textbutton, etc...)
