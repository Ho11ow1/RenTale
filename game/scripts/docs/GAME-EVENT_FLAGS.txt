=== How to use the FlagManager and work with FlagRef ===
Navigate to flags/GameFlags.rpy

To create a flag related to something specific,
create a new class and place a flag inside of it,
If you deem that to not be necessary, flags can also be made directly inside of the Flags class as such:
    flagName = FlagRef(int | bool)


To work with flags through the FlagManager:
Call the FlagManager singleton through FlagManager.Method() with the appropriate params.
All FlagManager methods are strongly typed so that everything shows up in testing and players have a smooth error free experience.

For example, to work with our already existing flags:
    $ FlagManager.Set(Flags.Main.MainEvent1, True) # This will work as MainEvent1 is a FlagRef instance, and its value holds a bool
    $ FlagManager.Increment(Flags.Side.SideEvent1, 3) # This will raise an error as SideEvent1's value is not of the int type
    $ FlagManager.Decrement("MyFlag", 2) # This will raise an error as "MyFlag" is not a FlagRef instance
