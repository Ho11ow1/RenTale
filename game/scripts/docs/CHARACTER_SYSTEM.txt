=== How to use ExtendedCharacter ===
Navigate to characters/Characters.rpy

Create your character like this:
default name = ExtendedCharacter("Name", color = "#hex", relationship="RelationShip")


When it comes to the relationship it all depends on your game.
In most cases this will either be a short description of the character or
the relationship between the player and that character (ex.: friend, teacher, aunt, etc...)


To use the character in dialogue it works exactly the same as a base Ren'Py character:
character "text"

And to modify stats:
1. $ character.stat += number
2. $ character.IncreseStat(StatType, amount) / $ character.DecreaseStat(StatType, amount)

The second example is recommended as it allows for type validation.
